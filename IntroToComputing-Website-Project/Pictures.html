	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though anime is enjoyed and watched globally, its roots find itself in Japan. By definition, anime is simply Japanese animation created by computer or hand. Anime is often thought to have originated in the early 20th century. The style of anime most people and familiar with took off in the 1960s with one of Japan's most prominent anime artist, Osamu Tezuka, and is leading the path for other artists to showcase their work domestically and internationally.</p>

	<p>The impact that anime culture has had on Japan is so great that it's birthed the otaku subcultures which includes role-playing, computer gaming, and cosplaying. All of these hobbies have huge followings both in Japan and internationally.</p>

	<p>In Japan, anime has such a large influence, you can find statues, other landmarks and sites dedicated to the anime culture and their creators. For instance, in Odaiba, visitors will be greeted by a monstrous life-size Gundam at the entrance of the building which hosts a small indoor theme park dedicated to the popular anime series.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Statues of anime characters, let alone giant statues, may be a rare sight in other countries, but in Japan, the anime or otaku culture is so normalized that many of these popular characters appear in other aspects of daily life. Other examples include anime themed products and packaging, snacks, and advertisements featuring popular characters, things you would not see so commonly outside of Japan. There are entire stores dedicated to these characters, such as the Pokemon MEGA center in Ikebukuro. This store is a Pokemon fan's dream come true and sells a selection games and merchandise that would be hard to find in other countries.</p>

	<p>Although you may be aware of the most popular anime characters and stories, it is difficult to really uncover the anime culture without visiting Japan. The name ‘otaku’ is used to refer to a super fan of anime and manga. The best place to experience anime culture is Tokyo, where you’ll find many unique things to do, such as manga cafes.</p>
