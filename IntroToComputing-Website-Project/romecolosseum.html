                        The sunlight made everything look even more stunning. The stone walls, worn by time, glowed warmly, and every crack and detail seemed to tell a story. Once inside, I was blown away by how much of it is still standing—it’s like a giant, open-air history book. Standing in the center, I could almost hear the echoes of the past.
                        The views from the upper levels were incredible. You can see so much of Rome from up there—the Forum, Palatine Hill, and all the charming rooftops of the city. It’s a reminder of how rich the history of this place is.
                        The guided tour I took really brought the stories to life, but even just wandering around, you can feel the energy of the place. It’s not just a monument; it’s a time machine. Visiting the Colosseum was unforgettable—a true bucket list moment.
