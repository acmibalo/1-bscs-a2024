                    <h5>01 - 09 - 2024</h5>
                    <p>
                        As a fresh graduate on a much-needed trip to Singapore, visiting Gardens by the Bay was like stepping into a futuristic wonderland. The mix of nature and technology is mind-blowing. The Supertree Grove caught my attention immediately—massive tree-like structures covered in plants, glowing with colorful lights as the sun went down. It felt like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The Cloud Forest dome was a personal favorite. Walking into that cool, misty space, with the world's tallest indoor waterfall right in front of me, was unforgettable
                        Flower Dome was another highlight, with its vibrant, perfectly curated gardens from different parts of the world. It’s amazing how they manage to make flowers bloom so beautifully indoors, even in Singapore’s tropical heat. At night, the Garden Rhapsody light show at Supertree Grove was magical. The music, the lights, and the atmosphere—it all felt surreal, like the perfect ending to the day.
