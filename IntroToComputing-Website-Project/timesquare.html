                    <h1>Time Square - United State</h1>
                    <h5>18 - 07 - 2016</h5>
                    <p>
                        Visiting Times Square is like stepping into a giant, glowing TV screen. The lights are so bright it almost feels like daytime, even at night. Everywhere you look, there are big billboards flashing ads, and the streets are packed with people.

                        The energy is wild. There are tourists taking pictures, street performers doing cool tricks, and people dressed as famous characters asking for photos. It’s noisy and super busy, but that’s what makes it exciting.
                        
                        I checked out some of the big stores, like M&M’s World, which smelled amazing, and grabbed a hot pretzel from a food cart. The best spot was the red steps at the TKTS booth. Sitting there, I could just watch everything happening around me—cars honking, lights flashing, and people from all over the world just soaking it in.
                        
                        It’s crowded, and a little crazy, but that’s what makes it so fun. Times Square feels alive, and it’s definitely a place you won’t forget.
