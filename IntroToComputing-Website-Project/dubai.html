                    <h1>Dubai - UAE</h1>

                        The moment I arrived in Dubai, I could feel the difference. Coming from Russia, where things are more laid-back and historic, Dubai hit me with its modern, futuristic vibe. The skyline is insane, with all these massive, shiny buildings like the Burj Khalifa that seem to touch the sky. It’s like stepping into a whole new world. Everything is super clean, organized, and just... high-tech.
                        In contrast, places like Moscow have a lot of history, old architecture, and a more relaxed pace of life. Dubai is like the complete opposite. It’s fast, flashy, and feels like a constant race to be bigger and better. The malls here are enormous, with luxury shops I’ve only ever seen in magazines, and the whole city seems designed for comfort and luxury. Coming from a place with a more traditional vibe, it was interesting to experience how modern and almost artificial Dubai feels. But honestly, it’s fun! It’s a place that feels like it’s always moving, and it’s exciting to be part of that energy.
