                    <h1>Milford Sound - New Zealand</h1>
                    <h5>15 - 07 - 2022</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Milford Sound coach & cruise tour is definitely worth the hype and as it is a full day, it is really nice to have someone else drive so you can focus on the views (or napping between stops if needed :)) We had perfect weather and got up close to several waterfalls so bring a rain jacket & spare clothes if you enjoy a natural shower! Kea birds, seals and a penguin were spotted as well. Enjoyed the meal on board, though I waited until we were on our way back in and missed the hot beverages, so make sure to grab early. I was only in Queenstown a few days & this tour was definitely worth it!
