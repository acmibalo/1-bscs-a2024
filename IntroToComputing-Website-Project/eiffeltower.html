                        Visiting the Eiffel Tower was one of those “pinch me” moments. I’d seen it in so many photos and movies, but standing there in front of it? Totally surreal. It’s way bigger in person than I imagined, and when you see it lit up at night, it’s like, wow, this thing really is as magical as everyone says.
                        I got there early to avoid the long lines (pro tip: book tickets in advance if you’re going up), and the view from the top is insane. You can see all of Paris laid out like a giant postcard. Even the elevators going up were cool, though a little nerve-wracking if you don’t love heights. It’s honestly such a vibe. Yeah, it’s touristy and crowded, but who cares? It’s the freaking Eiffel Tower. It’s one of those things you just have to see for yourself.                    </p>
