            The Philippines is considered a megadiverse country, with one of the highest rates of species discovery and endemism in the world—67% of its species are found nowhere else. It is home to an estimated 13,500 plant species, of which 3,500 are endemic. The country’s rainforests harbor an extraordinary variety of flora, including around 3,500 species of trees, 8,000 flowering plants, 1,100 ferns, and 998 species of orchids. Additionally, the Philippines hosts a diverse range of fauna, with 167 terrestrial mammals (102 of which are endemic), 235 reptiles (160 endemic), 99 amphibians (74 endemic), 686 birds (224 endemic), and over 20,000 insect species.

            As a critical part of the Coral Triangle ecoregion, the Philippines' waters are renowned for their exceptional marine biodiversity, including the greatest diversity of shore-fish species in the world. With over 3,200 fish species (121 endemic), the waters around the archipelago sustain the cultivation of fish, crustaceans, oysters, and seaweeds, contributing significantly to the country's economy and food security.
            
            The Philippines features eight major types of forests: dipterocarp, beach, pine, molave, lower montane, upper montane (or mossy), mangroves, and ultrabasic forests. In 2023, the country had about 7 million hectares (27,000 square miles) of forest cover, a significant reduction from the 70% forest cover in 1900. The loss of forest cover has been driven by widespread deforestation, which began under American colonial rule and intensified during the Marcos era due to unregulated logging. Despite rehabilitation efforts, forest regeneration has made only marginal progress.
            
            Recognizing the urgent need for conservation, the Philippines is a priority hotspot for biodiversity protection. It has over 200 protected areas, which cover 7,790,000 hectares (30,100 square miles) as of 2023. Three sites in the Philippines are included on the UNESCO World Heritage List: the Tubbataha Reef in the Sulu Sea, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, and the Mount Hamiguitan Wildlife Sanctuary, highlighting the nation's rich natural heritage and its commitment to preserving these unique ecosystems.
