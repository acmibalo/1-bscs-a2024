            The Philippines is an archipelago composed of approximately 7,641 islands, covering a total area of about 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 square miles). Stretching 1,850 kilometers (1,150 miles) from north to south, the Philippines is surrounded by seas: the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Sulu Sea to the southwest, and the Celebes Sea to the south. Its coastline spans an impressive 36,289 kilometers (22,549 miles), making it the fifth-longest coastline in the world. The country's exclusive economic zone covers 2,263,816 square kilometers (874,064 square miles), rich in marine resources.

            The Philippines' largest islands include Luzon, Mindanao, Samar, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol, and Masbate, which together make up about 95% of the country's land area. Its highest peak, Mount Apo, stands on the island of Mindanao, rising 2,954 meters (9,692 feet) above sea level. The longest river in the country is the Cagayan River, flowing for 520 kilometers (320 miles) in northern Luzon. Manila Bay, home to the capital city of Manila, connects to Laguna de Bay, the country's largest lake, via the Pasig River.
            
            Located on the western edge of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is prone to seismic and volcanic activity. The region experiences frequent earthquakes, averaging five recorded per day, although most are too weak to be felt. The last significant earthquakes occurred in 1976 in Moro Gulf and in 1990 in Luzon. The country is home to 23 active volcanoes, with Mayon, Taal, Canlaon, and Bulusan being the most active in terms of eruptions.
            
            Rich in mineral resources due to its complex geologic structure and seismic activity, the Philippines is thought to have the world's second-largest gold deposits, as well as large copper deposits and the largest known palladium reserves. Other valuable minerals in the country include chromium, nickel, molybdenum, platinum, and zinc. However, these resources remain largely untapped due to poor management, opposition from indigenous communities, and past environmental damage.
