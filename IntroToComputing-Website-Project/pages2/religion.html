            The Philippines is predominantly Roman Catholic, with approximately four-fifths of the population adhering to the faith. Catholicism grew significantly during the 20th century, not only in terms of the number of followers but also in the expansion of the church hierarchy and the establishment of seminaries. After 1970, the church became increasingly involved in the political and social life of the country. Notably, Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, emerged as a prominent and politically vocal figure, advocating for social change and human rights, especially during the latter part of the 20th century.

            Christianity in the Philippines is also represented by several other denominations, which make up around one-tenth of the population. The Philippine Independent Church, also known as the Aglipayans, was founded in 1902 as a response to Spanish control over the Catholic Church, and it has millions of adherents. Another significant Christian group is the Iglesia ni Cristo, an indigenous church established in the early 20th century, which, while smaller in size, continues to play an influential role in Filipino society.
            
            Islam has a long history in the Philippines, particularly in the southern regions of the country. Brought to the islands in the 15th century by traders from Brunei, Islam was already well established in the Sulu Archipelago and Mindanao by the time Europeans arrived. Today, the majority of the Muslim population, known as Moros, is concentrated in the southern islands, making up about 5 percent of the country's total population.
            
            Smaller communities in the Philippines also practice Buddhism, primarily among the Chinese-Filipino population. Additionally, some indigenous groups in rural areas continue to follow their own local religious traditions, preserving beliefs that have been passed down for generations.
