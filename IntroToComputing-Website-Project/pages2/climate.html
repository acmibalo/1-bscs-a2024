            The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate, characterized by hot and humid conditions throughout the year. It experiences three distinct seasons: a hot dry season from March to May, a rainy season from June to November, and a cool dry season from December to February. The southwest monsoon, known locally as habagat, occurs from May to October, while the northeast monsoon, or amihan, lasts from November to April.

            The coolest month in the country is January, while May is typically the hottest. Temperatures at sea level are generally consistent across the archipelago, with the average annual temperature hovering around 26.6°C (79.9°F). However, areas at higher elevations, such as Baguio (1,500 meters or 4,900 feet above sea level), have cooler temperatures, averaging 18.3°C (64.9°F). The country also has high humidity, with an average of 82 percent.
            
            Rainfall varies across the islands, with the eastern mountainous regions receiving as much as 5,000 millimeters (200 inches) annually, while some sheltered valleys receive less than 1,000 millimeters (39 inches). The Philippines is prone to typhoons, with about 19 typhoons passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) each year, typically between July and October. Of these, eight or nine usually make landfall. The wettest recorded typhoon in the country’s history occurred in 1911, when Baguio received 2,210 millimeters (87 inches) of rainfall over a period of five days.
            
            As one of the most typhoon-prone countries in the world, the Philippines is also ranked among the ten most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change. This vulnerability poses significant challenges, especially with rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and other climate-related impacts.
