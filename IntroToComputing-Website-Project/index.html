    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p>Attack on Titan is set in a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction, living inside massive walls to protect themselves from giant, man-eating creatures called Titans. The story begins when the outer wall is breached by a massive Colossal Titan, leading to widespread death and destruction.
 The series follows Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert as they join the military to fight back against the Titans and reclaim their world. As they confront these terrifying creatures, they uncover shocking truths about the Titans, the walls, and the dark history of humanity. What starts as a fight for survival evolves into a tale of freedom, morality, and the consequences of war.

    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey"><strong>The three walls of Paradis</strong></h3>
    <p class="w3-wide">
      <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;"> Wall Maria </p>
The outermost wall,offering the largest area of protection.
It was breached by the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan in the series' opening, leading to the fall of humanity’s outer settlements.<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">Wall Rose</p>
The middle wall, located inside Wall Maria.
It becomes the main line of defense after Wall Maria's fall and shelters the survivors.<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">Wall Sina</p>
The innermost and smallest wall, protecting the royal family and the most elite members of society.
It serves as the last line of defense and houses key secrets about humanity and the Titans.

   <h4 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey"><strong> Military Branches and their function </strong></h4>
   <p class="w3-wide">
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">Survey Corps</p>
    Also known as the Scouting Legion, has the primary job of protecting humanity and exploring beyond the walls to uncover the truth about the Titans and the world. 
    Their work is dangerous and requires immense bravery, as they frequently face Titans outside the relative safety of the walls.<br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">Garrison Regiment</p>
    They are responsible for the defense, maintenance, and management of the walls and the safety of the civilian population.
     Their role is crucial for ensuring humanity's survival within the confined space of the walls.<br>
     <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">Military Police Brigade </p>
      Responsible for maintaining law and order within the interior districts of the walls, protecting the royal family, and overseeing administrative duties.
      They are considered the most prestigious branch of the military due to their proximity to the elite and their relatively safe duties.

   <p class="w3-wide"
   < style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;"><strong> Marley </strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Marley is a powerful nation located outside of Paradis Island. It is situated on the mainland, and its empire dominates much of the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Government:</strong> Marley is a militaristic empire led by a monarchy, but the nation is heavily influenced by a ruling class and a militaristic elite.</p>
    <p><strong>Marley’s Use of Titans:</strong> Marley uses Eldian people (descendants of the original Eldians) as weapons, forcing them into service as Titan shifters and mindless Titans for military purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Titan Shifters:</strong> Marley controls seven of the Nine Titans and uses them to wage war and expand their power. Titan Shifters are Eldians who inherit the power of a Titan and are used as elite soldiers in Marley’s military.</p>
    <p><strong>Oppression of Eldians:</strong> The majority of Eldians in Marley are oppressed and treated as second-class citizens. They are forced to live in internment zones and are considered "devils" because of their bloodline, which gives them the ability to turn into Titans.</p>
    <p><strong>War with Paradis:</strong> Marley sees Paradis Island and the Eldian people living there as a major threat. Their goal is to conquer Paradis Island, take control of the Founding Titan (which is believed to be on Paradis), and use its power to assert dominance over the world.</p><br>
  
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif;"><strong> Eldia (Paradis Island) </strong></p>
<p><strong> Location:</strong>Paradis Island is an isolated island in the ocean, surrounded by three massive walls (Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sheena), where the last known remnants of Eldia live.</p>
<p><strong>History of Eldia:</strong>The Eldian Empire was once a mighty and oppressive empire that used the power of the Titans to conquer and control other nations. The Eldians possessed the power to turn humans into Titans, and their empire was built on Titan warfare.
After the fall of the Eldian Empire in the Great Titan War, the Eldian King King Fritz retreated to Paradis Island with his people to escape Marley’s retaliation. He used the Founding Titan’s power to isolate Paradis Island, erase the memories of the Eldians, and create the massive walls to protect his people from Titans and Marley.
Eldians on Paradis Island live in a state of ignorance about the outside world, believing that the walls are the last bastion of humanity and that the Titans are their only enemies.</p>
<p><strong>The Founding Titan:</strong> The power of the Founding Titan is central to the conflict. This Titan has the ability to control other Titans and alter the memories of Eldians. King Fritz used this power to erase memories and keep the people of Paradis Island in the dark about their true history.</p>
<p><strong>Survival and Isolation:</strong> The people of Paradis Island are isolated from the rest of the world, believing they are the last humans remaining. They live behind the three walls, which protect them from the Titans roaming outside.</p>
<p><strong>The Struggle for Freedom:</strong> The protagonists of Attack on Titan (Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert) begin to uncover the truth about the outside world, which is revealed to be controlled by Marley. This drives the conflict, as they learn of their oppressed status and the truth behind the Titans.</p>

<h6 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey"><strong>The Birth of the Titans</strong></h6>
<p>The Titans were created over 2,000 years ago, originating with Ymir Fritz, a young Eldian girl whose life changed forever due to a mysterious event.<br>
Ymir was a slave of the Eldian King and lived a life of suffering. While fleeing punishment, 
she fell into a deep tree-like pit. At the bottom, she encountered a mysterious, 
spine-like entity referred to as the “Source of All Living Matter.”<br>
This entity fused with Ymir, granting her the power to transform into the first Titan, known as the Founding Titan.
After gaining Titan powers, Ymir was used as a weapon by King Fritz, the ruler of Eldia.
She helped build the Eldian Empire through conquest and subjugation of other nations, including Marley.
Ymir’s abilities were also used to advance infrastructure and establish Eldia's dominance.<br></p>
