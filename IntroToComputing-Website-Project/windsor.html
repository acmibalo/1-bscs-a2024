                        What a fantastic heritage site this is. The Royal Collection Trust has done everything right at Windsor Castle - a brilliantly useful and informative website, easy pre-booking, speedy admission & security checks, a fantastic multimedia audio guide included in your ticket price, well maintained (as you would expect given this is still a working royal residence), excellent quality food in the Undercroft Cafe and, most of all, staff they should be supremely proud of. The customer service experience is delightful. Worth noting that in my party were my parents and children aged 3 to 15. My dad uses a mobility scooter to get around and absolutely everywhere was accessible and my parents commented on how many times they were offered unprompted assistance which made their experience a good one. The younger children loved Pug Yard (the onsite learning center) and took part in free activities including crafts (making helmets and swords to take home with them), storytelling and coloring. The older kids enjoyed the kid friendly version of the multimedia tour guide where Scorch the Dragon entertained and educated them. Had a fab time and would highly recommend.
