                    <h1>Cologne Cathedral - Germany</h1>
                    <h5>27 - 05 - 2016</h5>
                    <p>
                        When you first walk into the cathedral plaza and look up you cannot help but be impressed by the sheer scale and size of this enormous cathedral. It dominates the city from most angles in the modern day and I can only imagine how pilgrims visiting the cathedral or travelling along the river over several hundred years would have been awestruck by its grandeur. Inside is equally impressive with stunning stained glass windows, incredible architecture, interesting tombs and of course the unique relics of the 3 wise kings that attended Jesus’ birth. A modest discretionary donation is certainly worth the visit. For a fee the additional add on of visiting the Treasury underneath the building is interesting and enlightening and if you have the legs and don't mind tight spaces and narrow spiral staircases with a couple of hundred stairs the climb up one of the spires is certainly rewarding at the top. Can be very busy at peak times, so perhaps pick your visiting hours. 
It's a superb architectural experience in Köln. Its magnificent structure puts you in awe. It's so magnificent that it almost empowers the complete city by its existence. You go anywhere and you will keep seeing the Dome and its pillars. Amazing experience. Do take out lot of time to visit. Being in Europe one come across lot of Cathedrals but this one is exceptional. There is a big shopping area behind it prepare for lot of walks. It's located right near Köln Hauptbanhof and in case you have to get your hotel room you can cover this before moving ahead.
