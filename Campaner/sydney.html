                    <h1>Sydney - Australia</h1>
                    <h5>30 - 03 - 2019</h5>
                    <p>
                        Sydney is a place that’s really got it all: It’s a sunny, modern city, right smack in the middle of nature, where gallery-hopping, surfing, and fine dining can all happen before the sun goes down. Start with the views: Take the cliff top coastal walk from Bondi to Coogee, where you’ll pass by beaches, rock pools, and lush parks. Then there’s the world-famous Sydney Opera House—jutting up like a huge sailboat—anchoring iconic Sydney Harbour. It’s also worth seeing the city from the top down; the views from the Sydney Tower Eye observatory are nothing less than epic.
As a local, people are always asking me when to visit Sydney and my answer is always “anytime.” The city really does sparkle year-round with an average of seven hours of sunshine, which translates to plenty of outdoor time. There are so many different neighborhoods to explore but I recommend starting in the CBD. It surrounds the famous harbour and you'll find locals walking, running, picnicking in the sun, and taking in the views that never get old. From there, the city is your oyster. Here are some spots I absolutely recommend.
