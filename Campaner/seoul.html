                    <h1>Seoul - South Korea</h1>
                    <h5>24 - 10 - 2024</h5>
                    <p>
                        Seoul was such a pleasant surprise! As someone from Europe, I wasn't sure what to expect, but this city has a perfect mix of the old and the new. The modern skyscrapers and neon lights are everywhere, but then you turn a corner, and you're suddenly surrounded by beautiful traditional palaces and ancient temples. It’s like the city’s soul is stuck between the future and the past, and I loved that balance.
                        What really stood out for me was the food—so fresh and full of flavor. I’ve never tasted anything like kimchi, and the street food scene is out of this world! From sizzling tteokbokki to hot, crispy fried chicken, there’s always something tasty to grab on the go. The locals are super friendly, and getting around was a breeze with the clean and efficient subway system. Honestly, Seoul feels like a city that’s constantly buzzing with life, but also takes its time to honor its traditions. I can't wait to come back and explore even more!
