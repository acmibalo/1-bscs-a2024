        <p>
          As the co-founder of MAKE - Matalam/Municipal Advocates and Kabataan Empowerment, together with Cong. Samantha Santos, I want to share a message of inspiration and gratitude.

          Three years ago, organizing our first event was no easy feat. We faced numerous hardships and struggles, but our vision for a brighter future kept us moving forward. Today, I am filled with immense pride and joy as we celebrate our third year, having gathered almost a thousand Makers across the entire 3rd District of Cotabato Province. 
          
          Our journey hasn't been easy, but each challenge has only made us stronger. MAKE has grown from a small initiative into a vibrant, expanding family. Together, we have created a community where dreams can flourish, where every voice is heard, and where each individual's potential is nurtured.
          To all the Makers, your passion, dedication, and resilience have been the driving force behind our success. You have turned our shared vision into a powerful reality, and I am profoundly grateful to each of you.
          
          To our Governor and the Mother of Serbisyong Totoo, Hon. Emmylou “Lala” Taliño-Mendoza and to our active 3rd District Representative Congresswoman Hon. Ma. Alana Samantha T. Santos, my heartfelt appreciation to your unwavering support which has been crucial in our efforts to empower the youth and create opportunities for growth and development. Your belief in our purpose has been a driving force behind our accomplishments, and for that, we are truly grateful.
          
          As we look to the future, let's continue to support one another, lift each other up, and strive for excellence. Together, we can build an even stronger community where every Maker feels empowered to chase their dreams and make a lasting impact on the world.
          
          Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey. Your commitment and enthusiasm inspire us all.
