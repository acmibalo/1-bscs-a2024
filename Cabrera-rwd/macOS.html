            <h1>macOS</h1>
            <p>
                macOS is Apple’s operating system for Mac computers, developed by Apple Inc., which was co-founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. 
                It’s known for its user-friendly interface, stability, and security, integrating well with other Apple devices and supporting various applications, 
                featuring tools like Siri and Continuity for an enhanced user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                macOS gained popularity after the 2001 launch of Mac OS X, which combined the classic Mac OS with a Unix-based architecture, improving performance and stability. 
                Its attractive Aqua interface and user-friendly features drew in creative professionals and everyday users, with updates like the App Store in 2008 further boosting its appeal.
