            <h1>Linux</h1>
            <p>
                Linux OS is an open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 
                It is flexible and customizable, used on servers, desktops, and embedded systems. Popular among developers for its security and community support, 
                Linux offers various distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS tailored to different needs.

                Linux OS gained popularity in the late 1990s with the rise of the internet and demand for stable, secure servers. 
                Its open-source nature attracted developers, leading to user-friendly distributions like Red Hat and Debian. 
                Increased community support and adoption in enterprise settings further solidified its status as a leading choice for servers and desktops.
