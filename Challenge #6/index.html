        Claire Elizabeth Cottrill (born August 18, 1998), known professionally as Clairo, is an American singer-songwriter born in Georgia and raised in Massachusetts. She began posting music on the internet at age 13.
        Clairo rose to prominence following the viral success of the music video for her lo-fi single "Pretty Girl" in 2017. She subsequently signed a record deal, releasing her debut EP Diary 001 (2018) with Fader Label. Her debut studio album Immunity (2019) spawned the singles "Bags" and "Sofia", the latter of which became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Cottrill's second studio album, Sling, was released in 2021 to commercial success, debuting in the top 20 of the US Billboard 200. Her third studio album, Charm, was self-released on July 12, 2024, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Music Album.
