        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>
            There aren't any "frequently" asked questions since this isn't a widespread project, but here are some assumptions on what those would be:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Why are the other about pages and the faq just a wall of text?</strong><br>
            Rushed project bc I got admitted at the hospital for a good while, but the main appeal of all this is the game itself, the other stuff are just there due to necessity. I do hope you enjoy the game, even though it's not fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Will there be updates?</strong><br>
            Nope, absolutely not. This is a one-and-done thing I made so that I wouldn't turn into a one-and-done thing myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Will you nerf the blue walls?</strong><br>
            I don't plan on doing so. They seem pretty balanced to me, and if you find them difficult to deal with. Then I suggest you git gud.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>4. Is the page responsive?</strong><br>
            Hell yeah, imnida!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. What's something I wish I never knew?</strong><br>
            Orphaned newborn kittens have to be carefully monitored because they seek out the nipple so aggressively that they sometimes suck on the other kittensâ€™ penises to the point of injury.  
            Also, there are six missing nuclear bombs that we "know of."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. Why does the site seem so basic and lackluster?</strong><br>
            It does? then good, because I aimed for a retro sort of look that would resemble something from the early days of the internet.
