    <h2>ENHYPEN</h2>
    <center>
    <p>Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. 
       Formerly a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation,
       the group was formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land.
       The group consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo,
       Jungwon, and Ni-ki. They debuted on November 30, 2020,
       with the extended play (EP) Border: Day One.
       The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land.
       Etymologically, the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), 
       representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth".[5] Similar to how a hyphen
       connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect,
       discover and grow together to form a new act".
