        <p>I'm a comsci student that did all this so I would still be a comsci student in the following year to come. I enjoy being able to make games, one of my childhood dreams. To be honest after this I might start another project during break and work on another game. Of course it'll be pretty bad but that's fine since it is my first not rushed game. I hope to be able to make more interactive sites in the future and be able to help out other programmers. I didn't really find this project all that difficult since stackoverflow.com exists and there's also chatgpt to answer my questions (and fix my code bc how the hell was I supposed to know how collisions work in javascript.) Regardless of the difficulties I faced I still found all this to be pretty fun and frustrating. Also I like blue </p>
