        'Bout to show you what I'm workin' with, uh</p>

        <p>Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves<br>
        Scheherazade had a thousand tales<br>
        But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves<br>
        You got a brand of magic never fails</p>

        <p>You got some power in your corner now<br>
        Heavy ammunition in your camp<br>
        You got some punch (pizazz, yahoo) and how?<br>
        All you gotta do is rub that lamp<br>
        And then I'll say</p>

        <p>Mister, man, what's your name?<br>
        Whatever, what will your pleasure be?<br>
        Let me take your order, I'll jot it down<br>

        <p>Can your friends do this?<br>
        Can your friends do that?<br>
        Can your friends pull this<br>
        Out they little hat?<br>
        Can your friends go-</p>

        Well, I'm on the job, you big nabob<br>
