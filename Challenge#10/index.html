        <h1>ENHYPEN</h1>
        <center>
        <p>Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab. 
           Formerly a joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation,
           the group was formed through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land.
           The group consists of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo,
           Jungwon, and Ni-ki. They debuted on November 30, 2020,
           with the extended play (EP) Border: Day One.
           The name Enhypen was introduced during the live broadcast of the final episode of I-Land.
           Etymologically, the group derives their name from the hyphen symbol (-), 
           representing "Connection, Discovery, & Growth".[5] Similar to how a hyphen
           connects different words to create new meanings, Enhypen aims "to come together to connect,
           discover and grow together to form a new act".
